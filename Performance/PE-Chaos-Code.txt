1. Simulate Database Latency: Introduce a delay in the database service to test how the application handles requests when the database is slow.
2. Simulate Network Partition: Randomly drop requests to mimic network issues and observe the application's behavior.
3. Overload the Service: Increase the load on the API service beyond its capacity to identify failure points and ensure graceful degradation.
