# Chaos Engineering Scenario
1. Deploy the application in a high-availability mode with multiple instances.
2. Introduce latency in the database layer for 10% of requests.
3. Randomly kill 1 out of 3 service instances.
4. Monitor the system's ability to delete orders even with these injected failures.
5. Validate if the system remains resilient and responsive to user requests during the chaos experiments.
