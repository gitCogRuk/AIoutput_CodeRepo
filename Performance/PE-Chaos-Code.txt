1. Network Latency Simulation:
- Introduce random network delays ranging from 100ms to 5 seconds on the payment processing endpoint.
2. Service Outage Simulation:
- Randomly shut down the payment processing service for 30 seconds during peak loads.
3. Database Latency Simulation:
- Introduce artificial delays in database responses for transaction confirmation to test error handling and timeouts.
4. Load Test Configuration:
- Conduct tests under normal load (5000 users) and simulate chaos scenarios to observe system resilience and recovery capabilities.
